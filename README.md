# Crop-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

In this Jupyter Notebook File, I have tries all possible ML Models. This is a crop prediction dataset. I have attached the dataset in this repository. All the EDA and preprocessing are there.

All models gave as much accuracy as they can. Maximum accuracy is 99%. The best model for this dataset is RF, XGBoost, LightGBM which gain approximately 99% accuracy.
